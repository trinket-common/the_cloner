# The Cloner

This script can help you clone the repositories available in this organization and the objects needed to build a functional ROM for the available devices.

## Get Started ðŸš€

First, enter your work environment. This is an example to build <b> Lineage OS </b>
```
:~$ cd roms/LineageOS
:~/roms/LineageOS$
```

Now, clone this script according to the device you want to build:

<b>Doha:</b> `curl -o doha_staging.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trinket-common/the_cloner/staging/doha_staging.sh && chmod +x doha_staging.sh `

### Example
```
:~/roms/LineageOS$ curl -o <device>_<revision>.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trinket-common/the_cloner/<revision>/<device>_<revision>.sh;
:~/roms/LineageOS$ chmod +x <device>_<revision>.sh
```

Afterwards, just run the script and the whole project will be cloned automatically!
```
:~/roms/LineageOS$ ./<device>_<revision>.sh
```
